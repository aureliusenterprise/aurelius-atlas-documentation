<p>This page provides a collection of common scenarios that illustrate how Aurelius Atlas can help users address
common data governance challenges. Each user story highlights a specific use case and includes a walkthrough
to demonstrate how the platform can be used to solve the problem.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-data-governance-model">Building the Data Governance Model</h2>
<p>Establishing a data governance model is a critical step for organizations to ensure data quality, compliance,
and security. However, creating and maintaining a data governance model can be complex and time-consuming. Aurelius
Atlas simplifies this process by providing a centralized platform for defining and managing the data catalog,
data quality rules, and data lineage.</p>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: Contributing to the data governance model can be challenging for non-technical users.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Managing data governance across multiple systems and environments.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="benefits-and-features">Benefits and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>: Simplifies the process of defining and managing data governance rules through
    an easy-to-use editor.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Data Lineage</strong>: Integrate your DevOps and DataOps processes with Aurelius Atlas to automatically
    generate data lineage from your data pipelines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="walkthrough">Walkthrough</h3>
<p>Consider a scenario where a data governance manager needs to define a new data domain in the data governance model.
The manager uses Aurelius Atlas to create the new domain, define some of its attributes, and assign a domain owner.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>As opposed to the other user stories, this scenario is not available in the demo environment. To
follow along, deploy your own instance of Aurelius Atlas by following the <a href="../installation-and-deployment/">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>Further, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to create new entities in the data governance model.
You should at least have the role of <em>Data Steward</em> in the system.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="manual-entity-creation">Manual Entity Creation</h4>
<p>Start by navigating to the Aurelius Atlas landing page. Here, you can access the editor to create new entities
in the data governance model. Click on the <em>plus</em> button next to the search bar to open the editor.</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/building-the-model/building-the-model-01.jpg"><img alt="Open the Editor" src="../img/screenshots/building-the-model/building-the-model-01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The editor provides a user-friendly interface for defining new entities in the data governance model. Start by
selecting the entity type, in this case, a <em>Data Domain</em>. Enter the name of the new domain, such as <em>Equipment</em>,
and add a description to provide additional context. Finally, assign a domain owner to take responsibility for
the new domain.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>Include related keywords in the definition to make it easier for users to find the domain.</p>
</div>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/building-the-model/building-the-model-02.jpg"><img alt="Create a New Data Domain" src="../img/screenshots/building-the-model/building-the-model-02.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Once you have defined all the necessary attributes for the new domain, click the <em>Save</em> button to add the domain
to the data governance model. You are automatically redirected to the details page of the new domain, where you
can review the information you have entered.</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/building-the-model/building-the-model-03.jpg"><img alt="Review the New Data Domain" src="../img/screenshots/building-the-model/building-the-model-03.jpg" /></a></p>
<h3 id="automated-data-lineage">Automated Data Lineage</h3>
<p>In addition to manually creating entities in the data governance model, Aurelius Atlas also supports automated
data lineage generation. By integrating your DevOps and DataOps pipelines with Aurelius Atlas, you can automatically
register data producers, consumers, and transformations to generate comprehensive data lineage.</p>
<p><a href="../integrations/#lineage-api">Read more about the Lineage API</a> to learn how to integrate your pipelines with
Aurelius Atlas.</p>
<h2 id="cross-platform-data-governance">Cross-Platform Data Governance</h2>
<p>Organizations often use a mix of solutions from different vendors, incorporating various
clouds and on-premise systems. Data governance solutions from different cloud providers
focus on their specific platforms, making it difficult for organizations to get a comprehensive
overview of available data and data flows across all solutions.</p>
<h3 id="challenges_1">Challenges</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fragmented Data Governance</strong>: Different platforms have isolated governance solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Unified Data Catalog</strong>: No central repository to find and manage data across platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Data Flow Visibility</strong>: Difficult to trace data lineage across multiple systems.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="benefits-and-features_1">Benefits and Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unified Data Governance</strong>: Aurelius Atlas collects governance information from various systems.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Data Catalog</strong>: Serves as a central repository for organization-wide data.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Data Lineage</strong>: Visualizes data flows across different environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="walkthrough_1">Walkthrough</h3>
<p>Consider that we want to update the schema of a particular table in our data pipeline. We need to
know who is using the data and where it is being used to ensure all schemas and pipelines
are adjusted accordingly.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You can follow along with the scenario on the Aurelius Atlas demo environment.</p>
<p><a class="btn btn-success" href="https://aureliusdev.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/demo/atlas/">Go to the demo</a></p>
</div>
<h4 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h4>
<p>Start by searching for the table <strong>NL1-HR-001</strong> within the technical context.</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-lineage/data-lineage-01.jpg"><img alt="Search for NL1-HR-001" src="../img/screenshots/data-lineage/data-lineage-01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Navigate through the search results to locate and click on the entity with type <em>Dataset</em> for more detailed
information.</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-lineage/data-lineage-03.jpg"><img alt="Search for NL1-HR-001" src="../img/screenshots/data-lineage/data-lineage-03.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Once on the entity page of <strong>NL1-HR-001</strong>, you will see an overview providing essential details such as the
entity's name and type, its hierarchical breadcrumb, a description, and a summary of all elements available on
the page. Additionally, you can check the availability of the lineage model and find a navigation button for
quick access to related sections.</p>
<p>To explore the data lineage of <strong>NL1-HR-001</strong>, locate and click on the "Lineage Model" option provided either
in segment 5 or via the navigation button in segment 6.</p>
<p>The lineage analysis reveals that the data originates from a relational database, providing critical insights
into its storage location and other pertinent details, as depicted in the image below:</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-02.jpg"><img alt="Data Origin" src="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-02.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>From here, follow the data flow as it progresses into a Kafka topic. This step ensures effective communication
of change events through Change Data Capture (CDC). You can examine the source code and specifics of how the
data is stored and converted into a Kafka topic:</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-03.jpg"><img alt="Data Transformation" src="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-03.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Next, explore the final destination of the data, which is stored in an Elastic Search index. Understand the
source code and detailed attributes associated with this storage, including the transformation process into
an Elastic index:</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-04.jpg"><img alt="Data Destination" src="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-04.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>In the lineage graph of <strong>NL1-HR-001</strong>, visualize the comprehensive data flow across different systems,
including SQL server, Kafka, and Elastic. Aurelius Atlas ensures consistent data recording and visibility
across these varied environments:</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-05.jpg"><img alt="Data Flow" src="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-05.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>For more specific details, such as those related to the <strong>hr</strong> entity, click to uncover additional insights
about this particular component:</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-06.jpg"><img alt="Entity Details" src="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-06.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, review the available data in a Kibana dashboard. Click on the last event depicted in the lineage
model to access and explore this comprehensive dashboard, which provides detailed information about the
entity and its usage:</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-07.jpg"><img alt="Kibana Dashboard" src="../img/screenshots/data-cross-platform/cross-platform-07.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>By following these steps, you can effectively trace the data lineage across multiple cloud solutions and
ensure all subsequent processing is adjusted as required. As a result, we can update our schema accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="data-discovery">Data Discovery</h2>
<p>In a data analytics project, <strong>data scientists</strong> or <strong>data engineers</strong> often need to find specific data to answer
critical business questions. However, identifying relevant data, understanding where it is stored, and knowing
who to contact for access can be challenging, especially in organizations lacking data governance tools. This
process typically involves reaching out to multiple people and can be time-consuming and inefficient.</p>
<h3 id="challenges_2">Challenges</h3>
<ol>
<li>Lack of visibility into available data.</li>
<li>Uncertainty about data storage locations.</li>
<li>Difficulty identifying the accountable individuals for data access.</li>
<li>Time-consuming processes to understand data attributes and their meanings.</li>
<li>Inefficiency for engineers, particularly those with smaller networks within the organization.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="benefits-and-features_2">Benefits and Features</h3>
<p>Aurelius Atlas provides a centralized solution that makes information
about data availability, storage locations, and accountable contacts
easily accessible. The tool facilitates quicker and more efficient
data discovery and access, reducing the time and effort required to
find and understand relevant data.</p>
<h4 id="business-context">Business Context</h4>
<p>Users can search for data by entering relevant terms related to their
business context. The platform shows which data sets are available that

attributes help users understand the meaning and relevance of the data.</p>
<h4 id="storage-locations">Storage Locations</h4>
<p>Information about where the data is stored is readily accessible.</p>
<h4 id="accountability">Accountability</h4>
<p>Users can see who is responsible for the data, making it easier to request access.</p>
<h3 id="walkthrough_2">Walkthrough</h3>
<p>Let's consider a scenario where a data scientist needs to calculate the number
of people who currently work for their company as part of the annual report.
Therefore, the data scientist needs to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where is the data stored?</li>
<li>Who do I need to ask for permission to access the data?</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>

<h4 id="step-by-step-guide_1">Step-by-Step Guide</h4>
<p>Let's start on the Aurelius Atlas landing page. Here, the data scientist
can enter search terms like <em>employee</em>, <em>staff</em>, or <em>workforce</em>. See the
screenshot below.</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-discovery/business-context.jpg"><img alt="Data Discovery" src="../img/screenshots/data-discovery/business-context.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Here is an explanation of the highlighted elements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Business Context</strong>: The landing page has a dedicated section to help you
    get started exploring the business context of the data. You can enter search terms related
    to your business question to find relevant data sets.</li>
<li><strong>Info Panel</strong>: Click the question mark icon for an explanation of the business context meta model.</li>
<li><strong>Search Bar</strong>: Queries made through this search bar will have business context filters pre-applied.</li>
</ol>
<p>To search for employees, click the search icon and enter the term <em>employee</em>.
This will generate a list of results related to employees.</p>
<p>As a data scientist seeking entities representing employees, use the sidebar to
drill down and filter the results by data entities. Applying this filter will
narrow the results to 4 entities.</p>
<p>With this smaller set of results, review each entity individually. Compare the
entities <em>Personnel</em> and <em>Internal</em> by examining their breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs
indicate that <em>Internal</em> is a child entity of <em>Personnel</em>, showing a hierarchical
relationship between these concepts.</p>
<p><a href="../img/screenshots/data-discovery/data-discovery-2.jpg"><img alt="Data Discovery" src="../img/screenshots/data-discovery/data-discovery-2.jpg" /></a></p>
