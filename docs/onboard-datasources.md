# Onboarding Data Sources

The onboarding of data sources is a key step in creating a cohesive data governance model within Aurelius Atlas.
This guide demonstrates how to onboard two types of data sources into the Aurelius Atlas platform, walking through
the critical steps to integrate, monitor, and manage them effectively.

## Onboarding Data Dictionary from Excel File

Onboarding data from Excel files allows for quick and structured ingestion of tabular data, ideal for business
data dictionaries. This method is suitable when data is prepared in structured spreadsheets.

### Requirements

1. Ensure that data is clean, well-structured, and follows a consistent schema.
2. Data from Excel files must be stored somewhere with access to the kubernetes cluster.

### Technical Description of Excel

Below are the technical descriptions for each relevant column in the excel template.

### Running the module

- Update the `values.yaml` file

| Key                                        | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `{{ .Values.global.external_hostname }}`   | Specifies the domain name used for accessing the application.            |
| `{{ .Values.onboard_sources.source }}`     | Indicates the source type for onboarding, such as `excel` or `kafka`.    |
| `{{ .Values.onboard_sources.excel_file }}` | Defines the path or location of the Excel file used for onboarding data. |

- Create a ConfigMap with the Excel file data:

    ```bash
    kubectl create configmap excel-config --from-file=<my_excel_file.xlsx> -n <namespace>
    ```

- Apply the deployment:

```bash
helm template -s templates/onboard-sources.yaml . -n demo | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Onboarding Data from Kafka System

Onboarding data from Kafka allows for real-time ingestion of event-driven data streams, helping users
to locate Kafka topics, understand topic structures, and incorporate message metadata into Aurelius Atlas.
This integration is particularly useful for organizations working with large, dynamic datasets generated
by distributed systems.

### Data Model

In this onboarding method, Kafka topics are connected to Aurelius Atlas as datasets.
These topics contain message keys and other metadata, which are structured into the Aurelius Atlas data model
for improved searchability and discovery. Following this approach ensures that Kafka topics are organized
within a consistent governance structure, promoting data accessibility and transparency.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["System: Kafka Broker"] --> B["Collection: Default Cluster (ID)"]
    B --> C["Dataset: Kafka Topic"]
    C --> D["Field: Message Keys"]
```

- **System** - Kafka Broker:

    This component is the Kafka Broker that represents the technical system.

- **Collection** - Default Cluster (ID)

    This refers to a specific Kafka cluster that organizes and manages topics.

- **Dataset** - Kafka Topic

    A Kafka topic is a category or feed name to which messages are published.

- **Field** - Message keys

    This refers to the keys associated with the messages in a topic.

This process creates the data dictionary but does not include descriptions. Adding descriptions in the
Aurelius Atlas tool is important for improving data understanding.

### Running the onboarding module

The module can be run with a Kubernetes job. Please follow the steps below:

- Update the `values.yaml` file

| Key                                                 | Description                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{ .Values.global.external_hostname }}`            | Specifies the external hostname or domain name used for accessing the application. |
| `{{ .Values.onboard_sources.source }}`              | Indicates the source type for onboarding, such as API, file, or database.          |
| `{{ .Values.onboard_sources.bootstrap_servers }}`   | The Kafka bootstrap servers to connect to.                                         |
| `{{ .Values.onboard_sources.schema_registry_url }}` | The URL of the schema registry.                                                    |

- Run the `onboard-sources.yaml` job:

    Ensure that these files are not listed in the `.helmignore` file.

    ```bash
    helm template -s templates/onboard-sources.yaml . -n demo | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

## Onboarding General Data Sources

Onboarding general data sources into Aurelius Atlas involves a 5-step process to ensure seamless integration
and governance. This approach is designed for sources that do not fit predefined templates like Excel files or
Kafka streams but still require standardized ingestion and oversight.

### Methodology

The methodology for onboarding general data sources involves identifying the source type, establishing
connectivity, and mapping the source schema to the Aurelius Atlas data governance model. Below are the key steps:

#### 1. Assessment and Preparation

- Evaluate the source system to determine the format (e.g., API, relational database, file system, or cloud storage).

- Ensure the source data is clean, structured.

#### 2. Define Data Source Configuration

- Configure the required connection details, such as API endpoints, database credentials,
    file paths, or storage buckets.

- Map the source metadata, including field names, types, and any hierarchical relationships, to Aurelius
    Atlas's internal data model. For more details, please see [below](#data-model-components).

#### 3. Schema Mapping

- Identify key entities, attributes, and relationships in the source data. For examples, please see [our data model](#data-model-components).

- Map these entities based on Atlas's internal data model.

#### 4. Integrate and Test

- Use Apache Atlas API and our [our data model](https://github.com/aureliusenterprise/aurelius/tree/main/libs/m4i-atlas-core)
    to ingest the data. This can be done with the `ATLAS` user, for examples, see the onboarding with Kafka example.

- Verify that the ingested data aligns with the governance model.

#### 5. Automation and Monitoring

- Automate the ingestion process using Kubernetes jobs or scheduled pipelines.

- Monitor the data source for changes or updates, and re-ingest if required.

### Data Model Components

![alt text](img/meta_model.png)

The Data Model is composed of four foundational pillars: Person, Business, Technical, and quality.

For in-depth technical details, refer to our [m4i-atlas-core](https://github.com/aureliusenterprise/aurelius/tree/main/libs/m4i-atlas-core)
library.

#### How the Pillars Work Together

The four pillars of our Data Governance Model work together to ensure data is responsibly managed,
strategically aligned, and compliant with organizational policies:

- Person ensures oversight and accountability for the data.
- Business defines what data is needed and how it should be structured to meet organizational goals.
- Technical implements the systems and processes required to store, process, and transport the data.
