# Integrations

This page provides public APIs that users can utilize to interact with Aurelius Atlas.

## Apache Atlas API

Apache Atlas offers a versatile REST API designed for managing metadata entities,
types, lineage, and data discovery. This API provides endpoints for various operations
including entity CRUD, search functionalities, glossary management, lineage information
retrieval, and relationship management.

For detailed documentation and examples, refer to the [Apache Atlas API Documentation](https://atlas.apache.org/api/v2/index.html).

## Lineage Model API

This API enables fetching lineage information based on specified parameters
such as GUID, depth, and direction. It integrates with external services to
process and extract data, presenting structured lineage relationships between
entities and processes. Users can retrieve lineage details in a clear and
organized format using simple HTTP requests.

For further details and guidelines on usage, please visit the [API documentation](https://github.com/aureliusenterprise/aurelius/blob/main/backend/m4i-lineage-rest-api/README.md).
