## Troubleshooting Deployment

This section provides detailed steps to address common deployment issues.

### Connection is not safe

After many deployment attempts, it can happen that the reflector pod is not restarted automatically.

1. Check if there is a secret called `letsencrypt-secret-aureliusdev` in our namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n <namespace> get secrets
    ```

2. If it is not there, then find the reflector pod in the default namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl get all
    ```

3. Delete reflector pod (A new one will be created automatically):

    ```bash
    kubectl -n <namespace> delete pod/<podname>
    ```

### Pods Stuck in Initialization Phase

If some pods are stuck in the initialization phase, the source can be resource limitations on the cloud provider.

1. Check the status of all pods:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n <namespace> get pods
    ```

2. Identify the pods that are stuck in the initialization phase.

3. Check the events for the pods to understand the issue:

    ```bash
    kubectl -n <namespace> describe pod <podname>
    ```

4. If resource limitations are suspected, check the resource usage:

    ```bash
    kubectl top nodes
    kubectl top pods -n <namespace>
    ```

If resource limitations are causing pods to be stuck in the initialization phase,
you may need to increase the resources in your cloud provider.
Here are some steps to do this in Azure and Google Cloud:

#### Scale Up the Node Pool

1. Go to the Azure portal or Google Cloud Console.
2. Navigate to your Kubernetes service.
3. Select the node pool you want to scale.
4. Click on "Scale" and increase the number of nodes.
