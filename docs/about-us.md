## Aurelius Atlas

The inception of the open-source Aurelius Atlas was driven by a recurring issue we observed among our clients:
the aspiration to be data-driven was often hindered due to “data mess”. Rather than building a data governance
platform from scratch for each client, we created Aurelius Atlas—a comprehensive data governance software designed
to streamline the process.

By releasing Aurelius Atlas as an open-source project, we aim to empower the community with a powerful tool to
manage and govern their data more effectively. Join us in our mission to make data governance accessible and
efficient for all.
