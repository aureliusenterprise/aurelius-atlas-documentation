professionals working with data. The following user stories illustrate how the platform can help users overcome
these challenges and improve their data analytics workflows.

## Data Discovery

In a data analytics project, **data scientists** or **data engineers** often need to find specific data to answer
critical business questions. However, identifying relevant data, understanding where it is stored, and knowing
who to contact for access can be challenging, especially in organizations with a distributed data landscape and
lacking data governance tools.

## Data Lineage

Understanding the lineage of data is crucial for ensuring data quality, traceability, and compliance with
regulatory requirements. **Data stewards** and **compliance officers** need to track the flow of data from its
source to where it is consumed to ensure that it is used appropriately and that any transformations or processing
steps are correctly applied.

## Cross-Platform Data Governance

Modern enterprises often use a variety of data platforms and tools to manage and analyze data. Many platforms offer
data governance tooling, but these tools are typically designed for use with that environment only. **Data
scientists and engineers**, **data stewards**, and **compliance officers** need a unified solution that can provide
governance capabilities across multiple platforms.
